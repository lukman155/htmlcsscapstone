## Project Details

In this [project](https://lukman155.github.io/microverse_portfolio/), I set up, designed and deployed a personal portfolio website from a figma template. 
The goal here is to Understand how to parse a Figma design to create a UI..
I will use these techniques in all Microverse projects and most likely in my future job as well, so it is important to know them!
